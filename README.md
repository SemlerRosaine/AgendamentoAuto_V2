The software AgendarAuto V2 was developed with the same purpose of V1:  to manage the agenda of a car workshop, to facilitate the registration, control, editing, and exclusion 
of professionals, customers, cars, as well as manage the agenda with daily reporting. 

The difference is wich V2 does access control from the login screen. 
thus allowing production information what assists in the decision process. 

We used the Java language, the Hibernate framework, and the Java Swing package
